# 👽 We Can Fix Him / Are We the Bad Guys?

*A collaborative FGCU Game Dev Club project built with the open-source [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).*

This project is a **3D game using 2D assets**, exploring a strange bond between a human and an alien after a catastrophic event.  
The project’s later stages will experiment with integrating 2D assets into a 3D environment.

## 🎮 Premise

An alien invades a sci-fi research facility, wreaking havoc on its inhabitants.  
Just as the alien is about to be destroyed, it latches onto a dying human host to survive.  

Now weakened, the two must coexist in a **symbiotic relationship**—balancing between trust, control, and survival—until the alien regains strength.

## 💔 Choice System

Throughout the game, the player’s **choices** influence the relationship between the alien and the human.  
A **romance meter** tracks their bond, unlocking different endings based on emotional closeness.

**Possible Outcomes:**
- 💀 **Alien takes over human** → Human dies, alien becomes stronger.
- 💔 **Alien releases human** →  
  - Alien dies  
  - Human dies  
  - They both live (depends on choices)
- 💕 **Full hearts (Yaoi ending)** → They live together. *(Keep it PG!)*
