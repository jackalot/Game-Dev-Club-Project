This is a FGCU Game Dev club collaborative project. 

This project uses the open-source Godot engine and will be a 3D game using 2D assets. The later portion of this game is still being investigated on how to accomplish this feat.

Premise

    • Alien invades scifi facility, kills/maims many
    • Alien is almost defeated, is weakened
    • Alien attaches to human it almost killed
        ◦ symbiotic relationship, keep human alive until alien gets stronger
    • Character interactions/choices between alien and human
Choices
With a romance meter between the human and alien:
    • Alien takes over human, human dies (alien stronger)
    • Alien releases human, (medium hearts)
        ◦ Alien dies
        ◦ Human dies
        ◦ They both live
    • Yaoi – live together (full hearts)
        ◦ Keep it PG 
Gameplay loop
    1) Throw items at enemies
    2) Enemies drop
        1) crafting ingredients
        2) money
    3) Buy items and upgrades for both the human and alien
        1) Who ever has more upgrades is stronger
    4) Healing events
        1) What you can do during healing events:
            1) Train (gives a strength boost to whatever you choose)
            2) Talk to the alien
                1) Friendly choices 
                2) Hostile choices (trash talk?)
                3) Romantic choices
                    1) If you aren’t familiar with the alien much, your romance meter goes down (awkward)
                    2) Different options based on how close the alien and human are.
